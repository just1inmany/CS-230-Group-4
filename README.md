here are some ideas you may consider:
Opportunities like co-marketing (i.e. how your new headphones work great with nike shoes for a great workout)

special conferences, trade meetings where you could present your product/service
give aways, hackathons, promotional deals, etc.
Give REAL ideas not fake ones.   Mention real companies and provide links to their homepage.
